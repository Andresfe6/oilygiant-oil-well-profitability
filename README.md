# 🛢️ OilyGiant Oil Well Profitability Project

This project analyzes oil well production data for the fictional company **OilyGiant** to determine the most profitable regions for drilling. The goal is to use 
machine learning models to estimate production and guide investment decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze production data from three oil regions
- Build a regression model to predict daily output
- Calculate potential revenue and ROI per well
- Use statistical analysis to minimize investment risk

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- SciPy (for statistical testing)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files
- `OilyGiant Project.ipynb`: Full analysis and modeling notebook

## 🚀 How to run
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab
3. Run all cells in order
